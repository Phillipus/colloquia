<p>A constraint-based relative layout manager. The classes in this
package jointly implement a layout manager which uses a dependency
analyzer to support an arbitrary set of inter-component dependencies
(as long as they are consistent, and sufficient to fully constrain the
layout of the components). </p>

<p>The classes you'll interact with the most are the layout manager
itself, {@link
com.brunchboy.util.swing.relativelayout.RelativeLayout}, and the two
concrete {@link com.brunchboy.util.swing.relativelayout.Constraint}
implementations, {@link
com.brunchboy.util.swing.relativelayout.AttributeConstraint} and
{@link com.brunchboy.util.swing.relativelayout.AxisConstraint}.
</p>

<p>To simplify the construction of a rich set of constraints, you can
use an XML file parsed by {@link
com.brunchboy.util.swing.relativelayout.XmlConstraintBuilder}.</p>

<p>There is an introduction and tutorial for working with this package on
O'Reilly's <a href="http://www.onjava.com">ONJava</a> site.</p>
