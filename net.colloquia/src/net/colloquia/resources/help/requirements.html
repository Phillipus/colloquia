<font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><font size="4"><b>Requirements 
</b></font></font> 
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><b><i>Hardware and Software</i></b></font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><font size="2">Colloquia 
  1.3.2 will run on any Java 2 enabled platform. At the time of writing this includes 
  Windows 95, 98, 98SE, NT, ME, XP, and 2000, but NOT Windows 3.1. It also includes 
  MacOS X but not any earlier versions of the Macintosh operating system, although 
  earlier versions of Colloquia do run on MacOS 8 and 9. Linux and Solaris also 
  support Java 2.</font></font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Colloquia and Java 
  together require a minimum of 64Mb RAM (preferably 128Mb) plus 40Mb of free 
  space on the hard disk. A processor speed of less than 200MHz is not recommended.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Colloquia includes 
  Java in its installer, so there is no need to install it separately. However, 
  if you already have an installed version that is more recent than that supplied 
  with Colloquia, you will be able to choose that version when installing Colloquia.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><b><i>Internet access</i></b></font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><font size="2">Colloquia 
  is a software system for communication across the internet. Consequently you 
  will need an account with an Internet Service Provider, or be located within 
  an organisation that provides internet access.</font></font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Colloquia uses 
  normal email as its means of exchanging messages, so you will need to know some 
  details of the email system you will be using, which you can get from your Internet 
  Service Provider or system administrator. The information you need is as follows:</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Your email address<br>
  Your email account ID<br>
  Your email password<br>
  Your incoming mail server<br>
  Your outgoing mail server.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">These can also 
  be found in your email client, under your account details (this may be Outlook 
  Express or Netscape Communicator, for example.) Their precise location depends 
  on your email client and the version you are using.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Information on 
  how email transport works is provided in Appendix 3.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Colloquia can use 
  your normal email account to send and receive its messages, and can identify 
  and extract Colloquia messages from your email Inbox. However, it is possible 
  to delete Colloquia messages using your normal email client, so care is needed 
  to make sure that this does not happen. This is fully described in Appendix 
  2.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>To avoid these 
  possible problems, we recommend that you get a separate email account for use 
  only with Colloquia. Most ISPs provide several email accounts and Inboxes as 
  part of their service, so this should not cause any difficulty. Consult their 
  documentation on how to set up an additional email account.</b></font></p>
