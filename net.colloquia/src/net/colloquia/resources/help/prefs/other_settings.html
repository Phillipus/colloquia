<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><font size="4"><b>Setting 
  Preferences</b></font></font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">When you first 
  set up a new profile, you will be able to access the <b>Preferences Window</b>.</font> 
</p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b><i><font size="3">Other 
  settings</font></i></b></font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Click on the <b>Settings 
  Tab</b> to access the <b>Settings Window</b>. This window contains a number 
  of settings that allow you to control how Colloquia looks and operates.</font></p>
<p> <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The <b>Data Location</b> 
  is where all your Colloquia information is stored, including Messages, Resources, 
  information on People, and so on. It always ends in .cqd (for ColloQuia Data). 
  We advise, for simplicity's sake, that you use the default folder - but you 
  can change it if you wish by clicking on <b>Select Folder...</b></font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">You will be prompted 
  to make a backup to your hard drive every time you leave Colloquia if you put 
  a tick in the <b>Backup data on exit Box</b>. We recommend that you use this 
  option if you wish to secure archived safety copies of your data although you 
  may not wish to do this every time you exit Colloquia. The backup file location 
  can be changed if needed by selecting <b>Select a Backup Folder….</b> This could 
  be set to backup to a zip drive, for example, and then restored on a different 
  machine.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">If you put &quot;5&quot; 
  in the <b>Warn me to save every n mins Box</b> then you will be reminded every 
  5 minutes that you should save your work by a flashing Save icon on the main 
  Colloquia toolbar (you can choose to ignore these warnings!).</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">If you want to 
  quote messages to which you are replying, put a tick in the <b>Quote the original 
  message when replying to e-mails Box</b>.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">There are various 
  options for the <b>Look &amp; Feel</b> of Colloquia. Windows users can have 
  the traditional look and feel, Mac users can have the look and feel they are 
  used to, and there are also some Unix look and feels. Choose the one you like 
  from the menu provided.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">If the <b>Show 
  messages in Status Window Box</b> is ticked, this will allow you to see any 
  error messages.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Click on <b>OK</b> 
  once you are happy with all of your settings and they will be automatically 
  saved. You can now start using Colloquia.</font> </p>
