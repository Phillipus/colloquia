  Preferences</b></font></font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">When you first 
  set up a new profile, you will be able to access the <b>Preferences Window</b>.</font>

<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b><i><font size="3">Email

<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Clicking on the 
  <b>Email Setup Tab</b> will give you the <b>Email Setup Window</b>. It is of 
  crucial importance that the details required be entered correctly.<br>
  <br>
  </font><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>Appendix 
  3</b> explains the meaning of these settings. You can get these from your Internet 
  Service Provider, or by checking your normal email client for this information. 
  In Outlook Express 5, this can be found under <b>Tools-&gt;Accounts-&gt;Mail</b>. 
  In Netscape Messenger 4, the same information is under <b>Edit-&gt;Preferences-&gt;Mail 
  &amp; Newsgroups</b>.</font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b><i><font size="3">Using 
  a POP email account</font></i></b></font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">If you have to 
  use a POP email server for your incoming messages, there is a danger that Colloquia 
  messages could be diverted or lost by your normal email client. A POP email 
  account involves downloading all your email from the email server to your local 
  storage space, like your hard disk. If you check your email BEFORE checking 
  for Colloquia messages, then your Colloquia messages will also be downloaded 
  by your email client and saved onto your disk. Within your email client you 
  will see them listed, and if you try to open one, you will see a similar message 
  to &quot;This is a Colloquia message&quot;. You will also note that there is 
  an attachment to this message. Save this attachment in a folder on your hard 
  disk, and make sure that the name of this folder is the same as entered in your 
  Colloquia email settings under <b>Local Folder for Downloaded Messages</b>. 
  </font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">So, to recap, create 
  a folder in your Colloquia email settings under <b>Local Folder for Downloaded 
  Messages</b>, and make sure that any Colloquia message attachments that end 
  up in your normal email inbox are always saved in this folder.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">To avoid this cumbersome 
  approach we have three recommendations, as follows:</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">1. Use a separate 
  email account just for Colloquia OR<br>
  2. Use IMAP instead of POP, and ignore Colloquia messages that appear in your 
  email client (do NOT delete or save them) OR<br>
  3. Always check for Colloquia messages BEFORE checking your normal email.</font>
