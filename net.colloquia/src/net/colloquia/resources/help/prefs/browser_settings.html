<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><font size="4"><b>Setting 
  Preferences</b></font></font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">When you first 
  set up a new profile, you will be able to access the <b>Preferences Window</b>.</font> 
</p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b><i><font size="3">Browser 
  settings</font></i></b></font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Click on the <b>Browser 
  Tab</b> to access the <b>Browser Settings Window</b>. This window contains a 
  number of settings that allow you to control how the Colloquia internal web 
  browser operates.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>View web contents 
  automatically</b> - Ticking this box will allow web pages to display as soon 
  as you click on the Resource's name. You should only tick this if you always 
  work online. If you work offline, then having this box ticked will result in 
  Colloquia trying to access the Internet, and your machine launching its dial-up 
  connection.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>Level depth 
  for downloaded pages</b> - Colloquia allows you to save web pages including 
  all graphics and links. If you only want to save a single page and its graphics, 
  then select <b>1 Level Depth</b>. If you want to save the page and all the pages 
  linked from it, then select <b>2 Level Depth</b>, etc. We strongly advise that 
  you keep this set at <b>1 Level Depth</b> unless you have a specific requirement. 
  For example, if every page has an average of five links on it, then two levels 
  will result in six pages being downloaded, three levels will result in 31 pages 
  being downloaded, and so on. If you are not careful, you could easily end up 
  saving whole websites!</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>Automatically 
  unpack downloaded zip files</b> - This allows any zip files that have been downloaded 
  from an FTP URL in a Colloquia Resource to be automatically unpacked and referenced 
  in the Local File field of the Resource (see <b>Saving a non-web Resource</b> 
  for further details.) If this option is set, downloaded zip files are automatically 
  unzipped into a user specified folder and the first file contained in the zip 
  file is automatically referenced in the Resource's <i>Local File</i> field.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Note - if there 
  is a simple text file called <i>startfile</i> placed in the zip file, the file 
  name that is in this will be the file that is referenced in the <b>Local File</b> 
  field. For example, a tutor may wish to create a Resource that consists of many 
  dependent files with one main file as the file to launch. These files could 
  then be packed into a zip file together with the text file named <i>startfile</i>. 
  The <i>startfile</i> would contain one line of text - the name of the starting 
  file to be launched. See <b>Appendix 7 - Setting up zipped Resources.</b></font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><br>
  <b>File types that are to be downloaded or played by QuickTime</b> - Normally, 
  a URL is displayed in the Colloquia web browser as a web page. Usually this 
  will be an HTML file. However, some types of web page or file are not meant 
  to be displayed as HTML text and graphics and will require a special plug-in 
  or player in order to display them. By specifying a file extension here, the 
  browser will know that the file type is to be downloaded or played by QuickTime 
  instead of displayed in the browser. For example, zip files have the .zip extension 
  and will be downloaded and saved as local files on your computer. If the file 
  is a media file, such as an mp3 file, simply checking the QuickTime tick field 
  will ensure that it is played by the QuickTime Player (note, you will have to 
  install QuickTime on your computer for this to work.) </font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">To add a new file 
  type, click the plus (+) button and fill in the appropriate fields in the new 
  blank row that will be inserted at the end of the list. Don't forget to add 
  a dot (.) at the start of the extension type. Entries may be removed with the 
  minus button (-).</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Click on <b>OK</b> 
  once you are happy with all of your settings and they will be automatically 
  saved. You can now start using Colloquia.</font> </p>
