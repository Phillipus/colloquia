<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b><i><font size="3">Installation</font></i></b></font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The fact that you 
  are reading this guide means that you have already successfully downloaded Colloquia 
  from the website <a href="http://www.colloquia.net">http://www.colloquia.net</a>. 
  Installation simply involves double clicking on the downloaded installation 
  file and following the instructions. If you accept all the defaults, the Colloquia 
  software (and the Java Runtime Environment) will be installed in a directory 
  or folder at the top level of your hard disk, and the Colloquia icon will be 
  added to your desktop or Start Menu depending on your choice. This manual will 
  assume that you have the Colloquia icon on the desktop, and the software in 
  the default folder.</font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">If this is the 
  first time Colloquia has been launched, there will be no user profiles and the 
  <b>Start Colloquia Button</b> will be greyed out. To add yourself as a new user,

  to launch Colloquia and to access the <b>Preferences Window</b>. You must now

<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">If you select <b>Cancel</b>, 
  you will be returned to the <b>Add/Edit Profiles Window</b>.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">When you launch 
  Colloquia subsequently, all you need to do is display your profile, click in 
  the <b>Work on-line Box</b> to work online or unchecked to work offline, and 
  click on <b>Start Colloquia</b>.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">[<b>NB</b>: if

  to the Internet, and will try to get your messages immediately. If this box 
  is unchecked, then you will have to get your Messages after loading Colloquia.]</font></p>

  a profile name by clicking on <b>Add/Edit Profiles</b> to access the <b>Add/Edit

  such as Activities and Resources, will also be deleted. <b>NB: You will not 
  be able to retrieve this data once it has been deleted</b>.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">If you select <b>Don't 
  Delete Files</b>, only your profile will be deleted. The Activities and Resources 
  will still be accessible for reinstallation if necessary. You may want to choose 
  this option if you have two profiles as a result of having two separate email 
  addresses pointing to the same data. If you were to select <b>Delete Files</b> 
  at this point, you would delete the data to which your other profile was pointing 
  and you would no longer be able to retrieve it.</font></p>
