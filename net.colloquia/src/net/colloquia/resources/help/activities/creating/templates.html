<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">If you decide that 
  you want to reuse an Activity later with a different set of People, you can 
  store it in your Templates Folder. Simply drag and drop the Activity into the 
  folder, and a copy will be made there, preserving all of its description, Resources 
  and Assignments, but removing all the People. When you next want to use it, 
  drag and drop it back into the <b>Activity Folder</b>, and another copy will 
  be made to which you can add new People (you will also be encouraged to give 
  it a new name). </font> </p>
