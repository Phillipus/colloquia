  Activities</b></font></font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Whenever you make 
  changes to an Activity, such as adding or removing members, adding or removing 
  Resources, or adding sub-activities, you need to send updates to all the members. 
  You will be reminded of this by a change in the icon from <b>Live Activity</b> 
  <img src="../../../images/014.gif" width="24" height="24"> to <b>Hot Activity</b> 
  <img src="../../../images/078.gif" width="24" height="24">. Sending the Activity 
  is done in exactly the same way as before by highlighting the Activity to be 
  sent with a single click and sending it to all the students by clicking <b>Send 
  Activity</b> <img src="../../../images/058.gif" width="24" height="24"> on the 
  <b>Colloquia Toolbar</b>. </font> </p>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">This will start 
  the &quot;Send Activity Wizard&quot;, again taking you through the process of 
  sending the update, checking whether you and the learners have valid email addresses, 
  and allowing you to choose whether you send the Activity immediately or put 
  it in your Outbox for sending later. It will re-send the whole tree, with information 
  on People and Resources to all students, and on arrival in their Inbox, it will 
  replace the previous version in their Colloquia tree. All existing conversations 
  will however be preserved.</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Only the Activity 
  initiator can make changes to an Activity and send it to People. Recipients 
  can only participate in it. However, recipients can create sub-activities, which 
  they have complete control over. They can invite anyone they want to be part 
  of the Activity, whether or not they are members of the parent Activity. They 
  can exclude the owner of the parent Activity if they so wish in which case they 
  would not even know that the sub-activity existed.</font></p>
