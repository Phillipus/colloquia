  a Sub-activity</b></font></font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Sub-activities 
  allow you to structure your Activity by breaking it into sections. These may 
  be time based (Week 1, Week 2, etc), or may be used to put People into groups. 
  The process is exactly the same as adding an Activity. </font> </p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Select the <b>Activity</b> 
  with a single click and select <b>New Activity</b> from the <b>Insert Menu</b>. 
  Now follow the guidelines offered by the &quot;wizard&quot;, as you did before 
  when adding the parent Activity. You will be given the option to have the sub-activity 
  &quot;inherit&quot; the People from the parent Activity - if you wish this to 
  happen, tick the box provided.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">A new sub-Activity 
  will appear within the selected Activity in your tree.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">You can further 
  populate the new sub-Activity at any time as described in the <a href="adding1.html"><i><b>Activities</b></i></a> 
  Section.</font></p>
