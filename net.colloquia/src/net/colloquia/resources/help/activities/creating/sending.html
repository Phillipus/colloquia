<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><font size="4"><b>Sending 
  Activities to Participants</b></font></font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Once you have populated 
  your new Activity, and are ready to start, click <b>Send Activity</b> <img src="../../../images/058.gif" width="24" height="24">. 
  </font> </p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">This will start 
  the Send Activity Wizard. This will take you through the process of sending 
  it, checking whether you and the learners have valid email addresses, and allowing 
  you to choose whether to send the Activity immediately or put it in your Message 
  Centre's Outbox for sending later. It will send the whole tree, including People 
  and Resources to all recipients, where it will arrive in their Inbox, and become 
  part of their Colloquia tree, providing that they decide to accept it. </font></p>
<p> <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">If this is the 
  first time the Activity is sent, only Activity Invitations will be sent to recipients. 
  These allow them to see the description and objectives of the Activity, and 
  the names of People and Resources involved but not their details. People icons 
  will remain <img src="../../../images/004.gif" width="16" height="16"> until 
  they have sent back an acceptance, at which point the icon will cahnge to <img src="../../../images/004a.gif" width="16" height="16">. 
  This indicates that the person has accepted the Activity and is now ready to 
  receive the actual Activity Update. Once the actual Activity has been sent to 
  a Person the icon will change to <img src="../../../images/007.gif" width="16" height="16">. 
  If they decline the invitation, their icon will become <img src="../../../images/003.gif" width="16" height="16">.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The wizard provides 
  you with an opportunity to send out a mixture of Activity updates and Activity 
  invitations depending on the acceptance status of individual members.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">When Activities 
  are re-sent, then updates and/or invitations will be sent depending on whether 
  people have received an earlier version.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>NB</b>: People 
  only get each other's names and email addresses with an Activity - no other 
  details are sent by the initiator. Additional details have to be sent by the 
  person themselves, described later. People will also not get the details of 
  any sub-activities of which they are not members.</font></p>
