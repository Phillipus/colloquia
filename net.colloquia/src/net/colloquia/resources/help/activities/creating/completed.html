<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Completed Activities 
  stay on the Colloquia tree, and act as an archive of your previous actions. 
  In an educational context, this means that you have a record of the course you 
  took, the People you worked with, the Resources used, the Assignments you undertook 
  and all the discussions you were involved in. This can be seen as a portfolio 
  of your work, and if you use the Notes areas to add your reflections on your 
  learning, then it becomes a valuable record of your student experience. </font>

<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">As a tutor you 
  have excellent information on the course you have run and the students' experience, 
  allowing you to adapt your materials for future courses.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">In non-educational 
  contexts, Colloquia provides a record of projects and achievements, who participated 
  in them and what they did. Colloquia provides for a high level of self-organization, 
  but maintains excellent information on how projects unfold, and people's contributions, 
  permitting adaptive planning for future actions.</font></p>
