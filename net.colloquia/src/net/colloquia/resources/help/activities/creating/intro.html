  your own Activities</b></font></font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Every user of Colloquia 
  can also create and initiate their own Activities. In education, this means 
  that everyone can set up a study group, which they are responsible for managing. 
  In business or elsewhere, it means that any user can create an Activity centred 
  on their concerns or interests, and invite others to join them. </font> </p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">As described earlier, 
  an Activity contains: </font></p>
<blockquote> 
  <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">People participating 
    in the Activity<br>
    Learning Resources for that Activity<br>
    Sub-Activities, which contain:<br>
    Subsets of the People doing the Activity<br>
    Additional Resources (or subsets)<br>
    Sub-Activities, which contain:<br>
    ...and so on.</font></p>
