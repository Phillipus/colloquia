  Properties</b></font></font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">You can get all 
  the information about an Activity by selecting <b>Activity Properties</b> from 
  the <b>Activity Menu</b>. This has four tabs, and tells you when the Activity 
  was created and most recently modified, who created it, whether it accepts Resources 
  from members, and if it is a sub-activity, whether it inherits people from its 
  parent Activity. These last two can be changed at any time by clicking in the 
  appropriate box (if you created the Activity). </font> </p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The<b> Reactivate 
  Button</b> allows an Activity that was completed to be reactivated, and be re-sent 
  to all participants.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">You can also decide 
  what is displayed on the tree for the Activity in question. For example, if 
  an Activity contains a very long list of People, you might decide to deselect 
  the <b>Show People Checkbox</b>, only turning it on when you need to.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The <b>Activity 
  Updates Tab</b> shows the dates when different People last received an update.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The <b>Activity 
  Invites Tab</b> shows the list of invited People.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The <b>Member Status 
  Tab</b> shows who has been invited, and who has accepted the Activity. The possible 
  states are:</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>Accepted</b> 
  - the person has accepted the Activity and is an active member of it<br>
  <b>Pending</b> - awaiting the person's acceptance of the Activity<br>
  <b>Declined</b> - the person has declined the Activity<br>
  <b>Awaiting Activity</b> - the person has accepted the Activity and now needs 
  to be sent the Activity update</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The <b>Active</b> 
  checkbox allows you to de-activate a person from an Activity or activate them 
  again without actually removing them from the Activity structure.</font></p>
