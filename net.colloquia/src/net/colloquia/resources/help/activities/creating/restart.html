<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><font size="4"><b>Restarting 
  an Activity</b></font></font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">An Activity owner 
  can restart an Activity as follows by highlighting it and clicking on <b>Activity</b> 
  on the <b>Main Toolbar</b>. Select <b>Activity Properties</b> and click on the 
  <b>Re-Activate Button</b>. </font> </p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">A window will appear 
  asking if you would like to continue. Click on <b>Yes</b> and the re-activated 
  Activity will be sent out again showing the live status and re-inviting the 
  members to accept the restarted Activity. Click on <b>OK</b> and the icon in 
  your tree will change to <img src="../../../images/014.gif" width="24" height="24">.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">An Activity cannot 
  be re-activated (made live) if its parent Activity is Completed (i.e. an Activity 
  that is completed also has its sub-Activities completed.) In this case the Re-Activate 
  button will be greyed out.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>NB</b>: When 
  the owner completes a parent Activity, all sub-activities belonging to the owner 
  of the parent will also be completed. However, sub-activities set up by other 
  participants will continue to be active until they decide to end them. So, for 
  example, students can keep a study group going beyond the end of a formal course.</font></p>
