  in your tree will also change to the <img src="../../../images/010.gif" width="24" height="24"> 
  icon. A resignation message will automatically be sent to the Activity owner, 
  and your name will become greyed out on their version of the Activity. They

  their trees to also become greyed out. They can now delete you, if they wish. 
  You will no longer receive any Messages within this Activity.</font></p>
