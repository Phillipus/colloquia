  Activity Wizard</b></font></font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">When creating a 
  new Activity, it is assumed that it has not yet started, and so it becomes a 
  future Activity with the <img src="../../../images/078.gif" width="24" height="24"> 
  icon (reminding you it will need to be sent at some time). </font> </p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">To launch the Activity 
  Wizard, which guides you through the process, highlight the <b>Activities Folder</b> 
  in the left-hand frame with a single click and select <b>New Activity</b> from 
  the <b>Insert Menu</b>.</font></p>
<p> <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Enter a name for 
  the new <b>Activity</b> and decide whether or not you wish to allow participants 
  to submit Resources to your Activity - if so you should tick the box provided. 
  Click the <b>Next Button</b> (or the <b>Finish Button</b> if you do not want 
  to add People or Resources at this stage). You will be presented with the list 
  of people in your People Folder.</font></p>
<p> <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Select those people 
  you wish to participate in your new Activity by <b>Shift</b> or <b>Ctrl</b> 
  clicking on each Person (Macintosh users should use the <b>Command Key</b> instead 
  of <b>Ctrl</b>). <b>Shift</b> click selects a block of People, whilst <b>CTRL</b> 
  click selects People one by one. </font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Click the <b>Next 
  Button</b> and you will be presented with the list of Resources in your Resources 
  Folder. Select those Resources you wish to add to your new Activity by <b>Shift</b> 
  or <b>Ctrl</b> clicking on each Resource (Macintosh users should use the <b>Command 
  Key</b> instead of <b>Ctrl</b>). <b>Shift</b> click selects a block of People, 
  whilst <b>Ctrl</b> click selects Resources one by one. </font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Click the <b>Next 
  Button</b> and enter a title for an (optional) Assignment. Click the <b>Next 
  Button</b> and then click on <b>Finish</b>.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">You will be given 
  the option to click on <b>Finish</b> at every stage - you do not need to add 
  People, Resources or an Assignment at this stage.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">An Activity will 
  appear in the tree with the <img src="../../../images/078.gif" width="24" height="24"> 
  icon. If you open it you will see the items you have added to it. Resources 
  will have their usual icon <img src="../../../images/008.gif" width="16" height="16">, 
  but People will have the icon <img src="../../../images/004.gif" width="16" height="16">, 
  indicating that they have not yet accepted the Activity.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">You can further 
  populate the new Activity by 'dragging and dropping' or 'copying and pasting' 
  People and Resources from the top level folders to the specific learning Activity 
  by opening the People or the Resources Folder. Click on a <b>Person</b> (or 
  <b>Resource</b>) AND KEEP THE LEFT MOUSE BUTTON HELD DOWN. Drag the mouse pointer 
  until it is over your <b>Activity</b> and it has become highlighted. Release 
  the mouse button.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The Person or Resource 
  will have been copied into the Activity.</font></p>
