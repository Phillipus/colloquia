<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Colloquia Activities 
  are the heart of the system. The word &quot;Activity&quot; can represent a wide 
  range of entities. An Activity might be used to represent a whole course, or 
  a module, or a unit of learning Activity, or a project team, and many more things 
  we have not even thought of. </font> </p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">An Activity has 
  a description, objectives and is &quot;initiated&quot; by a single person who 
  controls what happens to it. Typically it &quot;contains&quot; a group of people, 
  a set of (optional) Resources, and (optionally) an assignment or task. It can 
  also contain sub-activities, which have People, Resources and Assignments and&#133; 
  sub-activities ad infinitum.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Sub-activities 
  can be set up by any of the participants in the parent Activity, and do not 
  have to include all the People in the parent Activity (not even the person who 
  set up the parent Activity). Sub-activities can also include People who are 
  NOT in the parent Activity.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">While this might 
  seem surprising at first, the reasoning behind this is straightforward. For 
  example, an Activity might be a module set up by a university tutor, including 
  all the students studying the module. One student might decide to set up a private 
  study group to discuss the course content. S/he does not need to include the 
  tutor in this, and might want to invite an old school friend studying the same 
  subject at a different university to join.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Only those who 
  are participants in a sub-activity will know that it exists.</font></p>
