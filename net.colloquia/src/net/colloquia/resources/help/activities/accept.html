<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><b><font size="4">Accepting 
  or rejecting an invitation</font></b></font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Invitations to 
  participate in Activities are automatically inserted in the tree with the <img src="../../images/011.gif" width="24" height="24"> 
  icon and its name alongside. This icon indicates that you have not yet accepted 
  (or rejected) the Activity. </font> </p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">If you click on 
  an <b>Activity</b> you have been invited to, an <b>Accept/Reject Wizard</b> 
  will be launched. If you accept the Activity, your correct personal details, 
  which you entered when setting up your Colloquia, are automatically sent to 
  the initiator, so that the e-mail address used is your preferred one. When you 
  are editing your details, you should bear in mind that these will be sent to 
  all participants whenever you accept an Activity.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Before you decide 
  to accept or decline the invitation, you can look at the description and objectives 
  of the Activity, as well as the titles of Resources to be used and the names 
  of other People invited to participate (but not their details). At this stage, 
  these are only displayed in the Main Frame and NOT in the tree. </font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Every time you 
  click on the Activity, a dialogue box will be displayed, asking you to accept 
  or decline the Activity. You can keep closing the box by clicking the <b>Cancel</b> 
  <b>Button</b>, to give you time to look at the Activity's details. You can do 
  this by clicking on the various tabs at the top of the Main Frame. Eventually, 
  though, you will have to reply by clicking on either the <b>Accept</b> or <b>Decline</b> 
  <b>Button</b> and on either <b>Send Now</b> (to send it immediately) or <b>Outbox</b> 
  (to store it for sending later).<br>
  <br>
  </font><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">If you decline 
  the Activity, the icon will change to <img src="../../images/049.gif" width="24" height="24">. 
  You may then delete the Activity by selecting <b>Cut Tree Node</b> from the 
  <b>Edit Menu</b>. </font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">If you accept the 
  Activity, the icon changes to <img src="../../images/050.gif" width="24" height="24">. 
  This indicates that your acceptance has been sent. When the initiator of the 
  Activity receives your acceptance, they will send an Activity update. When you 
  receive this, the Activity will become live as indicated by the <img src="../../images/014.gif" width="24" height="24"> 
  icon. </font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Examine the Activity 
  by selecting its various contents (you can open and close an Activity by double 
  clicking on it like any other folder).</font></p>
