<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><font size="4"><b>Resources</b></font></font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Items with the 
  <img src="../../images/008.gif" width="16" height="16"> icon are Resources that 
  the sender has provided for this Activity (e.g. a tutor may have provided learning 
  Resources). These will also appear in your Resources Folder. </font> </p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">If you click on 
  a <b>Resource</b> <img src="../../images/008.gif" width="16" height="16">, you 
  will see four tabs in Colloquia's top right hand frame, and a web browser will 
  appear in the frame below (with its own toolbar). Three of these were described 
  in detail in <a href="../resources/what.html"><i><b>The Resources Folder</b></i></a> 
  Section, and contain information about the Resource, as follows:</font></p>
<ul>
  <li><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The tab with 
    the Resource's name gives you information about it, including its URL</font></li>
  <li><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The <b>Description 
    Tab</b> tells you about the Resource</font></li>
  <li><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The <b>Notes 
    Tab</b> gives you a space to write your own notes about it</font></li>
  <li><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The <b>Activities 
    Tab</b> shows you all the Activities you are involved in that use this Resource.</font></li>
</ul>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Click on <b>URL 
  Button</b> <img src="../../images/026.gif" width="24" height="24"> in the browser's 
  toolbar to display the Resource, if it is not already displayed (you will need 
  a live internet connection).</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><b><i>Saving a Web Resource 
  as a local copy</i></b></font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><font size="2">You can save 
  a web Resource locally by clicking on Save in the browser frame. A progress 
  meter will be displayed while the Resource is being saved.<br>
  <br>
  </font></font><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">As 
  soon as the Save has completed, a reference will be automatically added to the 
  Local File Field, and from now on, you will be able to display the locally saved 
  version by clicking on the <b>Local Button</b> <img src="../../images/066.gif" width="24" height="24"> 
  in the browser. The web page and all its graphics and links will be saved. If 
  you have set the depth to greater than one (see the <a href="../prefs/other_settings.html"><i><b>Other 
  Settings</b></i></a> Section), then linked pages will also be saved locally.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><b><i>Saving a non-web Resource</i></b></font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><font size="2">If the Resource 
  is not a web page - for example a pdf file, then the internal Colloquia browser 
  cannot display it. Clicking on the <b>URL Button</b> </font><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><img src="../../images/026.gif" width="24" height="24"></font><font size="2"> 
  in the browser will cause the file to be saved locally (e.g. on your hard disk) 
  at a location of your choice.</font></font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">As soon as the 
  Save has completed, a reference will be automatically added to the Local File 
  Field, and from now on, you will be able to display the locally saved version 
  by clicking on the <b>Local Button</b> <img src="../../images/066.gif" width="24" height="24"> 
  in the browser.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">If the file does 
  not display correctly in the browser and you know that it should be a file that 
  is to be downloaded, then you may set the file type as downloadable in the <b>Browser 
  Settings</b> of the <b>Preferences</b> page (see <b>Browser Settings</b>.)</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><i><b>Adding Personal Notes</b></i></font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><font size="2">You can also 
  add personal notes about the Resource. Click on the <b>Notes Tab</b>, and then 
  add notes as described in the <a href="../people/notes.html"><i><b>Adding Personal 
  Notes</b></i></a> Section above. Remember that notes are private - no-one else 
  will have access to your notes.</font></font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><b><i>Finding out where 
  else the Resource is used</i></b></font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><font size="2">Clicking 
  on a <b>Resource's Activities Tab</b> while in the <b>Resources Folder</b> displays 
  a list of the Activities YOU ARE INVOLVED IN and that the Resource is being 
  (or has been) used in, its URL and who contributed the Resource. You can navigate 
  directly to any of these Activities by double clicking anywhere on the row that 
  contains its name.</font></font></p>
