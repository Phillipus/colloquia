  Activities in Colloquia</b></font></font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><font size="2">Activities 
  arrive as Messages in Colloquia, first as invitations to participate which you 
  can examine to decide if you want to accept them. If you accept an invitation, 
  then you will receive an Activity update, which will allow you to see information 
  on other People involved (i.e. those who have also accepted the invitation). 
  You will also be able to look at Resources included in it and to see any Assignment 
  or task it might involve (if the Activity is a type of course). Most importantly, 
  you will be able to participate in group and personal discussions in a unique, 
  context based way. All discussions have a conversation thread - the Messages 
  that you both send and receive are listed together to represent their proper 
  sequence. You will also be able to undertake the Assignment and discuss it with 
  the Activity initiator, and in some cases, contribute Resources of your own 
  to the group.</font> </font> </p>
