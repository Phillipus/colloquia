  1: Colloquia on a dial-up connection to the Internet</b></font></font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Colloquia requires 
  that your computer be set up to access the internet, so you must have an internet 
  account. If you are using a dial-up connection through a modem, you must: either 
  log on to the internet before you can send and receive Colloquia Messages (and 
  log off when you have got them), or set up you computer so that it automatically 
  connects to the internet when you click on <b>Get Messages</b> <img src="../../images/054.gif" width="24" height="24"> 
  or <b>Send Messages</b> <img src="../../images/077.gif" width="24" height="24">. 
  The latter option provides a smoother working method, but make sure that your 
  computer disconnects when you want it to. </font> </p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">We have provided 
  a number of features to reduce your phone bills or demand on bandwidth. You 
  can read and prepare all messages while offline, and you can save all Resources 
  for viewing offline. However if bandwidth or phone bills are not a problem, 
  Colloquia is happy to work in a permanently online mode.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Consult your computer's 
  manual or help system on how to do establish a dial up connection, and how to 
  get it to dial automatically when you request a web page or email download.
