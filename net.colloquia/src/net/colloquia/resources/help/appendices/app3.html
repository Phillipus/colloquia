  3: E-mail Servers and Settings</b></font></font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Email settings 
  can be rather confusing to people new to the Internet, so we provide here a 
  simple explanation how email works, which we hope will help with understanding 
  these settings. </font> </p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Email works in 
  a very similar way to the letter post. Physical mail has postboxes, where you 
  post your letter, and postal sorting offices, where your letters arrive before 
  being delivered by the postman. If you receive a registered letter, and are 
  not at home, the postman leaves a card asking you to go to the sorting office 
  to pick it up yourself. To use the postal service successfully, you need to 
  know the location or address of at least one (but preferably several) postbox 
  (es), and of your local sorting office.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Email is almost 
  exactly the same, except all messages are registered mail, so you need to go 
  and pick them up yourself. But you can post your mail in any postbox you want 
  - almost. </font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b><i><font size="3">Outgoing 
  Mail</font></i></b></font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Internet Service 
  Providers (ISPs) all have a post-box that you should use to post (send) your 
  messages. Some of them allow anyone to use their postbox, even people who are 
  not their customers. But many are now only allowing their customers to use them. 
  It is as if all postboxes were moved inside local banks, and only their customers 
  are allowed to use them.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">So it is advisable 
  to use your ISP's postbox, since others might reject you. In internet terms, 
  this is known as the &quot;Outgoing Mail Server&quot;, or the SMTP server (Simple 
  Mail Transport Protocol).</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">These often have 
  an address that start with SMTP. For example, if you use Freeserve as your ISP, 
  their outgoing mail server has the address SMTP.FREESERVE.CO.UK</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Outgoing mail servers 
  do not usually require a password - they simply check if you are one of their 
  customers, and reject you if you are not.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">If you are a nomadic 
  user, working in different places on your laptop, then you might need to use 
  different outgoing servers in different locations, depending on which ISP you 
  are using (work, home, or college). To help with this, Colloquia allows you 
  to add a number of SMTP servers to a menu in the Email setup, so that you can 
  select the one you want to use at any time.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b><i><font size="3">Incoming 
  Mail</font></i></b></font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">To collect your 
  mail, you need to go to the &quot;sorting office&quot;, which often (but not 
  always) has a different address. In internet terms this is known as the Incoming 
  Mail Server, and can be one of two types.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The most common 
  is known as a POP server (standing for Post Office Protocol). Another is known 
  as an IMAP Server (standing for Internet Mail Access Protocol). These differ 
  in several ways, but the most important is this: </font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">POP servers require 
  you to take your messages home before you read them (i.e. save them on your 
  computer's disk) although you can leave a copy at the Post Office.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">IMAP servers allow 
  you to read them AND store them at the Post Office (i.e. you do not have to 
  save them on your disk) - but you can save them if you wish. It also allows 
  you to set up a range of folders for storing your messages in as well as the 
  place where they arrive - the INBOX.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Many ISPs do not 
  yet support IMAP, but most universities prefer staff and students to use them. 
  They also have addresses similar to the Outgoing Mail Server. Again, Freeserve's 
  has the address POP.FREESERVE.CO.UK</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Colloquia treats 
  IMAP and POP servers in the same way. It always saves Messages on your hard 
  disk, and deletes them from the server unless you indicate otherwise on the 
  Email setup window. Deleting Colloquia Messages from the server makes sure that 
  they never appear in your normal email client.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b><i><font size="3">Email 
  accounts and Email addresses</font></i></b></font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Incoming Mail servers 
  always require that you have a user ID, which is NOT the same as your email 
  address, and a password. If you have an account on an incoming server, then 
  you do not have to be a customer. For example, if you are a student, you will 
  have an email account with your university, and you will have another given 
  to you by your ISP - just as if you had two addresses, your home address and 
  your university's address. You will need to pick up messages from two different 
  servers. Messages sent to your university address will arrive at their incoming 
  mail server. Messages sent to your private address will arrive at your ISP's 
  incoming mail server. So when you set up Colloquia, you need to know which email 
  account and which incoming mail server you plan to use - although you can set 
  up different profiles with different email accounts.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b><i><font size="3">Email 
  addresses and aliases</font></i></b></font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Whenever you are 
  given an email account, it has an associated email address, which always looks 
  like this:</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">xxx.yyyyy@some.where.co.uk</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">There are times 
  when you would prefer to use a different name to the one that you have been 
  given, and you can ask your ISP for an ALIAS. All messages to this alias arrive 
  in the same mailbox, so the only real advantage is that you might prefer the 
  name. </font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Quite often universities 
  give students numbers instead of names, like exp759@some.college.edu as their 
  &quot;real&quot; email addresses, but then give them an alias like j.smith@some.college.edu.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Colloquia uses 
  the email address to construct a unique identity for each user, so aliases can 
  cause some problems. If you use aliases, you MUST tell Colloquia in the<b> Email 
  Setup</b> window.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">If you have followed 
  the above explanation, you should have no difficulty in setting up your email 
  for Colloquia. </font></p>
