  2: Using Colloquia with your existing POP3 mail account</b></font></font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">If you have to 
  use a POP email server for your incoming messages, there is a danger that Colloquia 
  messages can be diverted or lost by your normal email client. A POP email account 
  involves you downloading all your email from the email server to your local 
  storage space, like your hard disk. If you check your email BEFORE checking 
  for Colloquia Messages, then your Colloquia Messages will also be downloaded 
  by your email client and saved on your disk. Within your email client you will 
  see them listed, and when you open one, you will see the text &quot;This is 
  a Colloquia message&quot; or similar. You will also note that there is an Attachment 
  to this Message. Save this Attachment in a folder on your hard disk, and make 
  sure that the name of this folder is the same as in your Colloquia email settings 
  under <b>Local Folder for Downloaded Messages</b>. </font> </p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Colloquia will 
  always look in this folder every time you click on <b>Get Mail</b> <img src="../../images/054.gif" width="24" height="24"> 
  as well as access your email server. However, if by chance you have saved the 
  Colloquia Message elsewhere, you click on <b>Import Mail</b> <img src="../../images/017.gif" width="24" height="24"> 
  on the <b>Colloquia Toolbar</b>, navigate to where you saved the Message(s), 
  and import them.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">So, to recap, create 
  a folder in your Colloquia email settings under <b>Local Folder for Downloaded 
  Messages</b>, and make sure that any Colloquia Message Attachments that end 
  up in your normal email inbox are always saved in this folder.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">To avoid this cumbersome 
  approach we have three recommendations, as follows:</font></p>
<blockquote>
  <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">1. Use a separate 
    email account just for Colloquia OR<br>
    2. Use IMAP instead of POP, and ignore Colloquia Messages that appear in your 
    email client (do NOT delete or save them) OR<br>
    3. Always check for Colloquia Messages BEFORE checking your normal email.</font></p>
</blockquote>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><br>
  <font size="3"><i><b>Using Colloquia with your existing POP3/IMAP mail account</b></i></font></font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">We have found a 
  way of simplifying the above procedures for those users at the University of 
  Wales, Bangor. On installation, Colloquia will set up its own inbox. It will 
  then separate, or 'filter', the Colloquia messages from the rest of your mail, 
  and place it in the new inbox. This means that Colloquia messages cannot be 
  diverted or lost by your normal email client, irrespective of whether you are 
  using IMAP or POP. </font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">However, this also 
  means that Colloquia messages are not seen in the 'Inbox' folder of your usual 
  e-mail client. If you would prefer them to remain visible in this inbox, you 
  can disable the filtering mechanism by deleting the file <i>.procmailrc</i> 
  from your M: drive. </font></p>
