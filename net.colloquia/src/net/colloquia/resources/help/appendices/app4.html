<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><font size="4"><b>Appendix 
  4: Colloquia data and where it is saved</b></font></font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">When you first 
  set up a profile in Colloquia, it creates a new user profile on your machine. 
  On a Windows PC this can be found in the C:\WINDOWS\COLLOQUIA\ folder. </font> 
</p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Here you will find 
  a file called XXXX.CQP and a folder called XXXX.CQD, where XXXX is the profile 
  name. The CQP file contains all your preferences that you entered when you set 
  up the profile - your name, address, email address, servers and so on. DO NOT 
  DELETE THIS FILE!</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The CQD folder 
  contains all the data that your Colloquia profile generates - Activities, People, 
  Resources, Messages and so on. Once again, do not delete or change anything 
  in this folder.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">If you use Colloquia 
  on several machines, then you will need to copy the CQP file and the CQD folder 
  to the same directory on the other machine. If you do this properly, then Colloquia 
  will immediately add you to the profile list on the new machine, and give you 
  access to the data.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">TAKE CARE to keep 
  the two machines' data properly synchronized. If you make changes on one machine 
  then copy this file and folder to the other before using it.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">You can use Windows 
  Briefcase to keep these files synchronized. Or you can use Colloquia's backup 
  facility:</font></p>
<blockquote>
  <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">In Colloquia's 
    Preferences, set the Backup Data Folder to an appropriate external storage 
    device such as a Zip Drive (see <b>Other Settings</b>). This data can then 
    be restored to another machine.</font></p>
</blockquote>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">All Colloquia data 
  files are very small, and so copying them should be quick and easy. The only 
  large files are downloaded Resources.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The <b>las</b> 
  folder contains all the Activities each with a unique ID. Each Activity Folder 
  contains a description of its &quot;tree&quot; plus a folder for any saved messages.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The <b>mail</b> 
  folder contains Messages waiting to be sent, plus information about your Message 
  Centre.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The <b>people</b> 
  folder contains information on every Person in Colloquia's People Folder, each 
  with a unique ID.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The <b>resources</b> 
  folder contains information on every Resource in Colloquia's Resources Folder, 
  each with a unique ID.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The <b>tree</b> 
  folder contains a description of the overall tree structure.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The <b>web pages</b> 
  folder is where locally saved web Resources are saved.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">All the files contained 
  within these can be viewed with a text editor like Notepad, but take great care 
  not to change them, as this will affect your Colloquia display and how it works.</font></p>
