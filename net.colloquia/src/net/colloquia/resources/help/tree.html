Colloquia Tree </b></font> </font> 
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b><i><font size="3">Hiding 
  and Showing People, Resources and Assignments</font></i></b></font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">As you add Resources 
  and People, and engage in more Activities, the information in the Colloquia 
  tree will grow rapidly, making navigation difficult and requiring lots of scrolling. 
  Most of the time it is advisable to keep the People and Resources Folders closed, 
  and earlier it was described how you could control what is displayed within 
  each Activity (see the <a href="activities/creating/props.html"><i><b>Activity 
  Properties</b></i></a> Section), using the Activity's Properties window.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">You can also globally 
  hide People, Resources, Assignments and completed Activities by clicking on 
  the icons on the small toolbar above the tree.</font></p>
<p> <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Clicking on <img src="../images/069.gif" width="16" height="16"> 
  hides all the People in all Activities.<br>
  Clicking on <img src="../images/070.gif" width="16" height="16"> hides all the 
  Resources in all Activities<br>
  Clicking on <img src="../images/071.gif" width="16" height="16"> hides all the 
  Assignments in all Activities<br>
  Clicking on <img src="../images/073.gif" width="16" height="16"> hides all completed 
  Activities.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Clicking on each 
  a second time redisplays the item in question as in Colloquia's previous state.</font></p>

  Things Around</font></i></b></font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">People can be dragged 
  into People Folders to help manage the long list that you will eventually get 
  in your <b>People Folder</b>. This is done by first inserting a new folder, 
  and then dragging People into it, as follows:</font></p>
<blockquote>
  <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Highlight the 
    <b>People Folder</b> with a single click. From the <b>Insert Menu</b> select 
    <b>New Person Group</b>. In the dialogue box that appears, enter a name for 
    it and click <b>OK</b>. A folder with that name will appear inside your People 
    Folder.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">To copy a Person 
    into the sub-folder, simply click on them, hold the mouse button down, and 
    drag them until the pointer is over the sub-folder, and release the mouse 
    button (this is called &quot;drag and drop&quot;). You will see their name 
    appear inside the folder AS WELL as remaining in the parent folder - they 
    have been copied into the new sub-folder.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">To copy a Person 
    into that folder and remove them from the parent folder, do exactly the same 
    as above, but hold the <b>Ctrl Key</b> down throughout the whole process.</font></p>
</blockquote>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Once you have sub-folders 
  in place, you can add new People directly into them by highlighting the sub-folder 
  first, and then following the process above.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">You can put groups 
  of Resources into folders to help manage the long list that you will eventually 
  get in your Resources Folder. This is done by first inserting a new Resource 
  Group folder, and then dragging Resources into it, as follows:</font></p>
<blockquote>
  <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">From the <b>Insert 
    Menu</b> select <b>New Resource Group</b>. In the dialogue box that appears, 
    enter a name for it and click <b>OK</b>. A sub-folder with that name will 
    appear inside your Resources Folder.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">To copy a Resource 
    into that sub-folder, simply click on it, hold the mouse button down, drag 
    it until the pointer is over the sub-folder, and release the mouse button 
    (this is called &quot;drag and drop&quot;). You will see its name appear inside 
    the sub-folder AS WELL as remaining in the parent folder - it has been copied 
    into the new sub-folder.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">To copy a Resource 
    into that folder and remove it from the parent folder, do exactly the same 
    as above, but hold the <b>Ctrl Key</b> down throughout the whole process.</font></p>
</blockquote>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Once you have Resource 
  Groups in place, you can add new Resources directly into them by highlighting 
  the sub-folder first, and then following the process above.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">You can further 
  populate the new Activity by 'dragging and dropping' or 'copying and pasting' 
  People and Resources from the top level folders to the specific learning Activity 
  by opening the People or the Resources Folder. Click on a person (or Resource) 
  AND KEEP THE LEFT MOUSE BUTTON HELD DOWN. Drag the mouse pointer until it is 
  over your Activity and it has become highlighted. Release the mouse button. 
  People Groups and Resource Groups can also be dragged onto Activities and their 
  members will be copied into the Activity (assuming that the Activity is yours.)
