<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><b><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><font size="4"><b>Adding 
  a Person</b></font></font></b></font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><b><font size="4"><i><font size="3">Adding 
  a person manually</font></i></font><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><b><font size="4"><i><font size="3"><a name="addpersonmanual"></a></font></i></font></b></font></b></font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">To add a person, 
  click on the <b>People Folder</b> once to highlight it. Then select <b>New Person</b> 
  from the <b>Insert Menu</b>, to give you the dialogue box for entry.</font> 
</p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Enter a name and 
  click <b>OK</b> (this need only be a short name if you so wish). This name will 
  appear inside your People Folder, and you will be able to add further details 
  in the <b>Main Frame</b>.</font></p>
<p> <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">In the <b>Main 
  Frame</b>, double click inside each field, enter the information and then press 
  Return to add further details.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">You can enter all 
  the other information, including browsing for and finding a photo or picture 
  (a .GIF or .JPEG file), just as you did when setting up your details earlier. 
  You can also resize the photo frame, and the image will adjust itself to fit. 
  However, this will be overwritten when the person updates you with their details, 
  so it might not be worth doing.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">If you have input 
  a URL for the person's home page, then you can view this using the built in 
  browser in the bottom half of the <b>Main Frame</b>. Click on the URL Button 
  <img src="../../images/026.gif" width="24" height="24">, and the web page will 
  be displayed, but make sure you are connected to the internet when you do this.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">[NB: you can also 
  save the person's home page locally, and view it offline - this is explained 
  in the section on <b><i>Saving A Web Resource</i></b>.]</font></p>

  <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><b><i><font size="3">Sorting 
  People</font></i></b><a name="sorting"></a></font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><font size="2">You can sort 
  people in the <b>People Folder</b> according to their short name (in the tree), 
  their first name, their surname or their email address. Click on the People 
  Folder to highlight it and to display the list of people in the <b>Main Frame</b>. 
  Clicking on each heading causes the list to be sorted alphabetically by that 
  heading. Clicking on the same heading again reverses the direction of the sort 
  (i.e. from ascending to descending). Any sort you do is reflected in the list 
  of people in the <b>People Folder</b> on the tree.</font></font></p>

  <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><b><i><font size="3">Putting 
  People into sub-folders</font></i></b></font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><font size="2">You can put 
  groups of People into folders to help manage the long list that you will eventually 
  get in your People Folder. This is done by first inserting a new folder, and 
  then dragging people into it, as follows:</font></font></p>
<blockquote>
  <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Highlight the 
    <b>People Folder</b> with a single click. From the <b>Insert Menu</b> select 
    <b>New Person Group</b>. In the dialogue box, enter a name for it and click 
    <b>OK</b>. A sub-folder with that name will appear inside your <b>People Folder</b>.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">To copy a Person 
    into the sub-folder, simply click on the <b>Person</b>, hold down the left 
    mouse button, and drag that <b>Person</b> until the pointer is over the sub-folder. 
    Then release the mouse button (this is called &quot;drag and drop&quot;). 
    You will see the <b>Person</b>'s name appear inside the sub-folder AS WELL 
    as remaining in the parent folder - they have been copied into the sub-folder.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">To copy a person 
    into the sub-folder and remove them from the parent folder, do exactly the 
    same as above, but hold the <b>Ctrl Key</b> after clicking on the Person to 
    be copied.</font></p>
</blockquote>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Once you have sub-folders 
  in place, you can add new people directly into them by highlighting the sub-folder 
  first, and then following the process in the <i><b><a href="#addpersonmanual">Adding 
  A Person Manually Section</a></b></i>.</font></p>
