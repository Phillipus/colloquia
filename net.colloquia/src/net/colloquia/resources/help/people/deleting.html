<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><font size="2">You can only 
  delete a person from your People Folder if that Person is not involved in any 
  of your Activities. If this is the case, their name will be in <i>italics</i>. 
  Otherwise, you will have to find all the Activities they appear in (using the 
  <b>Activities Tab</b>), delete them from those, and then delete them from the 
  <b>People Folder</b>. If a person belongs to an Activity initiated by someone 
  else, then you will not be able to delete that Person until that Activity is 
  completed.</font></font> </p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">To delete a <b>Person</b>, 
  highlight their name and select <b>Cut Tree Node</b> from the <b>Edit Menu</b>.</font></p>
