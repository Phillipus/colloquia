<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><b><font size="4">Other 
  ways People get added to your People Folder</font></b></font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><b><i>When receiving Activities 
  sent to you</i></b></font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><font size="2">When you 
  begin to use Colloquia, you will receive and join in Colloquia Activities others 
  have set up and asked you to join. These will usually include several other 
  people, who as well as appearing in the Activity Folders, will also get added 
  automatically to your People Folder. However, you will not be able to change 
  any of their details. </font></font> </p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>Comment: The 
  list of people with whom you interact will grow depending on how wide the range 
  of Activities is in which you are involved. You can also create new Activities 
  to which you can invite and introduce people that you met in different Activities. 
  In this way, Colloquia can be seen as a tool that helps with networking.</b></font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><b><i>Importing People</i></b></font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><font size="2">If you already 
  have a list of people you need to enter into Colloquia in a spreadsheet or database, 
  you can import them into Colloquia. First, you need to reorganize the fields 
  in the spreadsheet or database to be in the same order as in Colloquia, i.e.:</font></font></p>
<blockquote> 
  <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Surname, first 
    name, address, phone, email address, and ID (even though some of these may 
    be blank)</font></p>
</blockquote>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">and then save the 
  spreadsheet or database file in tab delimited format.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Finally, highlight 
  the <b>People Folder</b> with a single click, and select <b>Import People</b> 
  from the <b>File Menu</b>. Browse and find the tab delimited file, select it, 
  and the list of people will be imported and appear in your tree. </font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Take care with 
  this - it is very easy to get text in the wrong fields!</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><b><i>Adding People directly 
  to an Activity Folder</i></b></font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><font size="2">You can add 
  people directly to an Activity Folder that you are setting up. This is done 
  in exactly the same way as adding them to the People Folder, except that you 
  first highlight the <b>Activity Folder</b> with a single click instead of the 
  People Folder (see the <a href="Adding%20a%20person.html#addpersonmanual"><i><b>Adding 
  A Person Manually Section</b></i></a>). </font></font></p>
