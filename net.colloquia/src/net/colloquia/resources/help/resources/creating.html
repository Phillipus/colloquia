  a complete Resource</b></font></font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Quite often people 
  want to create a new Resource from scratch. This might be a Word document, a 
  web page, or anything else that can be made on a computer. Once it has been 
  created, it needs to be put on a server to be accessible to others. Colloquia 
  provides support for the uploading of such a Resource to an ftp site. </font> 
</p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Before you start, 
  you need access to an ftp site, and permission to upload files to it. Usually 
  this involves you having an address for it (e.g. ftp://ftp.some.site.com/myspace/), 
  an ID (e.g. jon999) and a password (e.g. drowssap).</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">This example assumes 
  you have already made a Resource that is a .pdf file and is saved on your disk 
  with the title &quot;MyResource.pdf&quot;. You need to be connected to the internet 
  to do this.</font></p>
<blockquote>
  <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">1. Create a new 
    Resource in your <b>Resource Folder</b>, e.g. called &quot;My Resource&quot; 
    as described in the <a href="adding.html"><i><b>Adding A New Resource</b></i></a> 
    Section.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">2. Now we need 
    to set the location of the file. Click on the <b>Local File</b> button in 
    the Resources's data sheet.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">3. Browse your 
    disk until you have located the file, and click <b>Open</b>. The Local File 
    path is set to your selected file.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">4. You may add 
    other details and a description if you wish.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">5. From the <b>Communications 
    Menu</b>, select <b>Upload Resource</b>. The Upload Resource screen will allow 
    you to enter the correct details. The Wizard will guide you through the rest 
    of the process. </font></p>
</blockquote>
<p> <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">When you click 
  <b>OK</b>, the file will be uploaded, and the appropriate URL will be inserted 
  in the <b>URL Field</b>.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">If the ftp site 
  requires password access for those intended to access the Resource, they will 
  be prompted for an ID and password before they will be allowed to save or display 
  the Resource. Once you have completed this, the information will be stored for 
  next time.</font></p>
