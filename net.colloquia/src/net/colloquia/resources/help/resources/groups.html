  Resources into Resource Groups</font></b></font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">You can put groups 
  of Resources into folders to help manage the long list that you will eventually 
  get in your Resources Folder. First insert a new Resource Group Folder, and 
  then drag Resources into it, as follows: </font> </p>
<blockquote>
  <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Highlight the 
    <b>Resource Folder</b> with a single click. From the <b>Insert Menu</b> select 
    <b>New Resource Group</b>. In the dialogue box, enter a name for it and click 
    <b>OK</b>. A sub-folder with that name will appear inside your <b>Resources 
    Folder</b>.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">To copy a Resource 
    into the sub-folder, simply click on the <b>Resource</b>, hold the left mouse 
    button down, drag the <b>Resource</b> until the pointer is over the sub-folder. 
    Then release the mouse button (this is called &quot;drag and drop&quot;). 
    You will see the <b>Resource</b>'s name appear inside the sub-folder AS WELL 
    as remaining in the parent folder - it has been copied into the sub-folder.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">To copy a Resource 
    into the sub-folder and remove it from the parent folder, do exactly the same 
    as above, but hold the <b>Ctrl Key</b> down throughout the whole process.</font></p>
</blockquote>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Once you have Resource 
  Groups in place, you can add new Resources directly into them by highlighting 
  the sub-folder first, and then following the process in the <a href="adding.html"><i><b>Adding 
  A New Resource</b></i></a> Section.</font></p>
