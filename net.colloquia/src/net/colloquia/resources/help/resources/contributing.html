  a Resource</b></font></font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">You may offer a 
  Resource to the owner of the activity, provided that they have allowed this 
  when they set up the activity. To find out if this is the case, right-click 
  on the activity on the tree, and select <b>Activity Properties</b>. To add the 
  Resource, place it in the Activity using copy and paste, or drag and drop. Then 
  select <b>Send Resource</b> from the <b>Communications</b> menu.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Note - the <b>Send 
  Resource</b> option will be greyed out if the parent Activity is <b>not</b> 
  set to accept Resources. Also there are a number of conditions that apply as 
  to whether you can send the Resource depending on whether the Resource is yours 
  and where you have selected it in the tree:</font></p>
<ul>
  <li><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">If you select 
    a <i>Resource that you have created</i> in a <i>Resource Group</i> (i.e. you 
    have selected the Resource &quot;globally&quot;), you can send it to everyone 
    who is a member of an Activity that you created where this Resource occurs.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">If you select 
    a <i>Resource that you have created</i> in an<i> Activity that you have created</i>, 
    you can send it to every active member of that Activity (you can also use 
    this option to update Activity members with a new or changed Resource without 
    sending the parent Activity again).</font></li>
  <li><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">If you select 
    a <i>Resource that you have created</i> in an <i>Activity that you have <b>not</b> 
    created</i>, you can send it to the creator of that Activity and they can 
    then choose whether to send it on to the other members of the Activity.</font></li>
</ul>
