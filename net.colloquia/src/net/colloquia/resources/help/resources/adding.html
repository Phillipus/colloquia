<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><font size="4"><b>Adding 
  a new Resource</b></font></font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><b><i>If you know its URL</i></b><a name="url"></a></font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><font size="2">To add a 
  <b>Resource</b> to your <b>Resource Folder</b>, click on it once to highlight 
  the folder. Select <b>New Resource</b> from the <b>Insert Menu</b>, to give 
  you the dialogue box for name entry.</font></font> </p>
<p> <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Enter a name and 
  click <b>OK</b> (this need only be a short name if you so wish). This name will 
  appear inside your <b>Resource Folder</b>, and you will be able to add further 
  details in the <b>Main Frame</b>.</font></p>
<p> <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Notice that in 
  the tree, the Resource has been added simply by its name that you entered, but 
  in the Main Frame, the full title has been added, as well as various other details. 
  Double click inside each field, enter the information and then press <b>Return</b> 
  to add further details.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">If you have put 
  in a URL for the Resource, then you can view this using the built in browser 
  in the bottom half of the Main Frame. Simply click on the <b>URL Button</b> 
  <img src="../../images/026.gif" width="24" height="24">, and the web page will 
  be displayed - but make sure you are connected to the internet when you do this. 
  You can also save and then view a local version, as described in the <i><b>Saving 
  A Web Resource </b></i>section.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">You can add any 
  Resource which can be downloaded from a web or ftp server, even if it cannot 
  be displayed by the browser - these will simply be saved instead of displayed 
  (see the <i><b>Saving A Non-Web Resource </b></i>section).</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><b><i>Directly From the 
  Browser</i></b></font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><font size="2">A typical 
  way of adding Resources is to browse or search the web using the browser, and 
  reference it when you have found one you want to add to your Resource Folder. 
  Simply click on the <b>Create Button</b> <img src="../../images/067.gif" width="24" height="24"> 
  in the browser to do this. This will give you a dialogue box and from here, 
  the process is identical to that previously described in the <i><b><a href="#url">If 
  You Know Its URL</a> </b></i>Section.</font></font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><b><i>Updating a URL</i></b></font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><font size="2">If you find 
  that a URL has changed for one of your Resources, you can use the browser to 
  find the new location, and then click on <b>Update URL</b> <img src="../../images/030.gif" width="24" height="24"> 
  in the browser. This will update the URL in the Resource's URL field (assuming 
  this information is currently displayed - if you do not take care you could 
  easily update the wrong Resource!)</font></font></p>
