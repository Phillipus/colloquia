  a Resource</font></b></font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><font size="2">You can only 
  delete a Resource from your Resources Folder if it is not used in any of your 
  Activities. If this is the case, its name will be in <i>italics</i>. Otherwise, 
  you will have to find all the Activities it appears in (using the <b>Activities 
  Tab</b>), delete it from those, and then delete it from the <b>Resources Folder</b>. 
  If a Resource is used in an Activity initiated by someone else, then you will 
  not be able to delete it until that Activity is completed. </font></font> </p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">To delete a Resource, 
  highlight its name and select <b>Cut Tree Node</b> from the <b>Edit Menu</b>.</font></p>
