  Folder</b></font></font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><b><i>What it is for</i></b></font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><font size="2">The <b>Resources 
  Folder</b> is where all your references to materials are listed. These are typically 
  web-based Resources, which can be displayed or downloaded from a web or ftp 
  server. However, other Resources can be listed here, such as those that have 
  a local file reference, or even a physical location. </font></font> </p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Resources can be 
  organized into folders for easy management, and you can track which Activities 
  they are used in. </font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Web Resources can 
  be saved locally and displayed when offline. Locally stored Resources that cannot 
  be displayed with the web browser will launch the appropriate application (e.g. 
  Adobe .pdf files will launch Acrobat Reader). Online Resources that cannot be 
  displayed with the web browser will be saved locally, and can then be displayed.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Double clicking 
  on the <b>Resource Folder</b> opens it, displaying the list of Resources underneath, 
  and the <b>Main Frame</b> displays information about the Resources. These can 
  be used for sorting the list of Resources.</font></p>
<p> <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Highlight the 
  Resource name by clicking on it to display its information.<br>
  <br>
  You can view a description of the Resource (if there is one) by clicking on 
  the <b>Description tab</b>. You can view the Resource itself by clicking on 
  the <b>URL Button</b> <img src="../../images/026.gif" width="24" height="24"> 
  in the Browser Frame (make sure you are connected to the internet first).</font></p>
