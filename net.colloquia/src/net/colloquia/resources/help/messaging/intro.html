  in Colloquia</b></font></font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Colloquia has a 
  number of unique messaging features, and offers a number of ways of navigating 
  your Messages. Before we explain how to engage in Colloquia Activities, here 
  is an overview of the key concepts and facilities provided to help with messaging. 
  </font> </p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">You can receive 
  six types of Message:</font></p>
<table width="100%">

</table>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">All Messages received 
  are immediately put in their proper locations, as follows:</font></p>
<ul>
  <li><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Activity invitations 
    appear within the Activities Folder in your Colloquia tree.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Updates to existing 
    Activities appear within the Activities Folder in your Colloquia tree.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Group Messages 
    about an Activity <i>can only be viewed from within that Activity</i>. New 
    Messages are indicated by the number of unread Messages, e.g. &quot;(3 unread)&quot;, 
    next to the Activity's name.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Personal Messages 
    about an Activity <i>can only be read from within the Activity</i>. New Messages 
    are indicated by the number of unread Messages, e.g. &quot;(2 unread)&quot;, 
    next to the <i>Person's name within the Activity</i>.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Assignments 
    appear within the Activity Folder to which they belong.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Personal details 
    replace that Person's details everywhere they appear in your Colloquia tree 
    (the People Folder and all the Activities in which they are involved.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Resources appear 
    within the Activity to which they belong (and in your Resources Folder).</font></li>
</ul>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Information about 
  the number of messages and whether they have been read or not can be obtained 
  by:</font></p>
<blockquote> 
  <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Group Messages 
    - The number of unread messages is displayed in brackets against the Activity 
    name on the tree, e.g. &quot;(3 Unread)&quot;. Hovering the mouse cursor over 
    the Activity name on the tree allows a tool tip to display the number of total 
    Group messages for that Activity, e.g. &quot;Messages: 2&quot;</font></p>
  <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Personal Messages 
    - The number of unread messages is displayed in brackets against the person's 
    name in the Activity on the tree, e.g. &quot;(3 Unread)&quot;. Hovering the 
    mouse cursor over the Activity name on the tree allows a tool tip to display 
    the number of total Group messages for that Activity, e.g. &quot;Messages: 
    2&quot;</font></p>
</blockquote>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">It is very important 
  to note that unlike most email clients, Messages are NOT read from within an 
  Inbox. They are always read IN CONTEXT - i.e. from within an Activity. By casting 
  your eye down your (opened) Colloquia Activities Folder, you can quickly see 
  where you have unread Messages. </font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">As a further aid, 
  Colloquia provides a <b>Message Centre</b> <img src="../../images/053.gif" width="24" height="24">, 
  accessible from the <b>Colloquia Toolbar</b>, which provides a catalogue of 
  all Messages you have received and sent.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> At the top of 
  the Message Centre are five tabs entitled: <b>Unread</b>, <b>Read</b>, <b>Unsent</b>, 
  <b>Sent</b> and <b>Unmatched</b>.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Clicking on each 
  in turn gives you a list of Messages. </font></p>
<ul>
  <li><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The <b>Unread</b> 
    list displays all Messages (of any sort) received and not yet read. As soon 
    as they have been read, they are automatically removed from this list.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The <b>Read</b> 
    list contains all the Messages you have received and read (transferred from 
    the Unread list).</font></li>
  <li><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The <b>Unsent</b> 
    list contains all the Messages you have written but not yet sent.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The <b>Sent</b> 
    list contains all the Messages you have written and sent.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The <b>Unmatched</b> 
    list contains any Messages that to not appear to have a location. This would 
    normally be empty, but there are some unusual circumstances when you might 
    get a Message which has no home (e.g. if your email delivers a Message BEFORE 
    you have received its Activity).<br>
    </font></li>
</ul>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">You can delete 
  any item in a list by highlighting it and clicking <b>Delete</b> <img src="../../images/021.gif" width="24" height="24">. 
  You can select multiple items by holding down <b>Shift</b> or <b>CTRL</b> and 
  clicking on them.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Similarly, you 
  can mark messages as being read by clicking the Mark button <img src="../../images/031.gif" width="24" height="24">. 
  Effectively, this marks the message as being read and places a copy of it in 
  the Read list.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">You can use the 
  Message Centre to navigate to any of the Messages. Double-click on a Message, 
  and you will be taken to the correct place in Colloquia where the Message is 
  located, and it will be displayed. You can use the Message Centre to:</font></p>
<ul>
  <li><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Make sure you 
    have read all new Messages</font></li>
  <li><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Find old Messages 
    whose location you cannot remember.</font></li>
</ul>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The Message Centre 
  toolbar also allows you to check for new Messages on your Mail server by clicking 
  on Get Mail <img src="../../images/054.gif" width="24" height="24"> (the same 
  as on the main Colloquia toolbar, see the <i><b>Receiving Messages in Colloquia</b></i> 
  Section).</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">It also allows 
  you to import any Messages you might have saved on you disk using your normal 
  email client, as described in <a href="../prefs/email_setup.html"><i><b>Email 
  Setup</b></i></a> Section.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Clicking on <b>Send 
  Mail</b> <img src="../../images/077.gif" width="24" height="24">, which also 
  appears on the main Colloquia Toolbar, can send any Unsent Messages. They can 
  also be re-edited by double clicking on them, which will put you back in context 
  (i.e. back in the Activity to which they belong).</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Remember - entries 
  in the Message Centre are<b> pointers to the actual message</b>. To view a referenced 
  message you need to double-click on the row in the message table to be taken 
  to the message in its Activity context. Thus, deleting a message reference in 
  the Message Centre table does not actually delete the original message.</font></p>
