# Colloquia - a Peer-to-Peer Learning Management and Groupware System

**This project is no longer maintained.**

I've uploaded the code here for posterity. The code is...not so brilliant but it does still run on Windows 10 and MacOS with Java 8 or 11 (not tested on Linux).

Colloquia started life as the "TOOMOL" project (**Too**lkit for the **M**anagement **o**f **L**earning) and you can read about that here - https://www.academia.edu/278667/The_TOOMOL_Project_Supporting_a_Personalised_and_Conversational_Approach_to_Learning

The instigators of the project were Sandy Britain, Oleg Liber, and Bill Olivier. 

Then, on September 2nd 1998 I came on board as developer, and the app was called "Learning Landscapes". In 1998 Java was in its infancy and new to me ("Teach Yourself Java in 21 Days" read in 3 days). Development continued in one form or another until 2005. During this time the app was renamed "Colloquia".

The following is what we used to say...

Colloquia

- is a peer-to-peer learning management and groupware system
- supports and encourages self-organising groups
- provides asynchronous group and personal conversation facilities
- allows personal information to be shared between participants
- allows learning and other online resources to be referenced and accessed
- has an inbuilt web browser
- runs on all Java enabled platforms

Colloquia is a software system that supports group working and group learning. It allows any user to set up a working or learning group around a particular topic (a context), add people to it, add resources (web pages, documents etc) to it, set up group tasks, and then engage in group and personal "conversations" about the topic.
 
To support this way of working, users can continually build a library of resources they can use in different contexts, and have access to detailed information about the people they are working with. These are "dragged and dropped" into new contexts.
 
Contexts can have sub-contexts, which can be set up by any participating member, containing sub-groups of members, additional resources and new tasks. Contexts and sub-contexts are only seen by their members.
 
Unlike most other groupware systems, you can do almost all of your work offline, making it ideally suited for those working at a distance and who have difficulty maintaining a permanent internet connection (either because of cost or for technical reasons). No server software is needed - all that is required is an email account for each user, plus our software. Perfect for the laptop user!*
